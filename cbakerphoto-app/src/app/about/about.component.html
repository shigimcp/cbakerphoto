    <p>Chuck Baker began his lifetime career in photography at an early age - sweeping floors in a camera shop at the age of twelve and going on assignment for <i>The Dallas Times Herald</i> before his sixteenth birthday. After spending three years shooting still lifes for Neiman Marcus in Texas, Chuck moved to New York City to open a studio.</p>
    <p>Capturing people in the midst of every day activities while somehow portraying these moments as much deeper and graphic experiences, Chuck Baker’s style was quickly discovered by the legendary Carrie Donovan. She hired him to create four entire new sections of <i>The Men’s Fashion of The Times</i>, followed by hundreds of pages of women’s fashion features, which then resulted in an impressive list of clients.</p>
